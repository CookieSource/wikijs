<p>Download the file: <a href="https://osdn.net/dl/rebornos/RebornOS-ARM-Installer-2.3.sh">RebornOS-ARM-Installer-2.3.sh</a></p>
<p>To start the script, type</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo ./RebornOS-ARM-Installer-2.3.sh</code></pre>
<p>...in the console. After entering the password, the script starts with the instruction to close all file managers.</p>

<p>Then you can choose between LXQt and Xfce desktop environments:</p>

<p>In the next step select the SD card you want to install RebornOS on, I use a USB SD card adapter so the drive is declared as <code>/dev/sda</code> for a sdcard reader included your computer use <code>/dev/mmcblk0</code>:</p>

<p>After the basic settings are made, the script partitions the SD card and formats it.</p>

<p>The script now searches for a mirror from which to download the RebornOS. This file is over 3 GB in size and it takes time to load it:</p>

<p>After downloading the file, it is also unpacked and copied, which of course takes time given the size of the file:</p>

<p>The next steps are synchronising with, and resizing the SD card:</p>

<p>The script ends with the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The default user is <strong>alarm</strong> with the password <strong>alarm</strong></p>
  <p>The default root password is <strong>root</strong></p>
</blockquote>
