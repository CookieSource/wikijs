## Write image to eMMC

Instructions on how to write the image files to the eMMC:

### From Linux

-   [ ] After you have put your device into maskrom mode, verify this from your system.

```plaintext
sudo rkdeveloptool ld
```

Output should look something similar to this:

> DevNo=1 Vid=0x2207,Pid=0x350b,LocationID=801 Maskrom

-   [ ] Download [rk3588\_spl\_loader\_v1.09.111.bin](/arm/rk3588_spl_loader_v1.09.111.bin) then run:

```plaintext
sudo rkdeveloptool db ~/Downloads/rk3588_spl_loader_v1.09.111.bin
```

> If you get "The device does not support this operation!" re-plug the device.

-   [ ] Write the image you downloaded.

```plaintext
sudo rkdeveloptool wl 0 ~/Downloads/RebornOS-ARM-r58x-2023-01-14.img
```

> Replace the path and name with the path where the extracted image is.

-   [ ] Reboot the device:

```plaintext
sudo rkdeveloptool rd
```
