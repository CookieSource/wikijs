Once the installer has loaded, we will find the following screen:

![](https://gitlab.com/rebornos-team/rebornos-images-for-wiki/cnchi-images/-/raw/main/cnchi-0001.png)

On this screen, in the lower panel, we will see the shortcuts for (from left to right):

**1.** The Firefox browser.  
**2.** The file manager.  
**3.** The text editor.  
**4.** Gparted (the disk partitioner).  
**5.** The first shortcut to the installer (blue RebornOS icon).  
**6.** The second shortcut to the installer (green RebornOS icon).  
**7.** The RebornOS Welcome Screen.  
**8.** The terminal.  
  
  
If we close the installer, and click on the icon of the first access of the installer (the RebornOS icon in blue), cnchi will load all the mirrors by default.  
On the contrary, if we click on the icon of the second access to the installer (the RebornOS icon in green), the installer will run without updating any mirror to its default condition.  
  
  
**NOTE: How to use the installer shortcuts**

As you may have seen, the cnchi installer now offers two shortcuts to start the installer: one blue, and the other green.

Why?

Upon launching the installer by clicking on the blue RebornOS icon, cnchi will restore Arch Linux mirror files to their initial condition. Therefore, if the user closes the installer, and then runs for example reflector from the terminal to update the Arch Linux mirror listing, and then runs the installer again from the blue icon, this updated listing will be replaced by the mirrors originals offered by cnchi.

In order for the installer not to perform this replacement of the mirrors file generated by reflector, the user will have to start cnchi from the green RebornOS icon. Next, for cnchi to use the new updated list of mirrors created by reflector, the user must select, in the '''Mirrors selection screen''', the option '''Leave the mirrors lists as they are'''.

You can read about using reflector, on the Arch Wiki: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Reflector](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Reflector)

Continuing with the use of cnchi...

By clicking on the **Install it** button, we will access the following screen:

Above and to the right of the cnchi installer screen, we will see two buttons: the first, an arrow pointing to the left, is the back button, and the one next to it is the forward button (right arrow).  
On this screen, we will select the RebornOS installation language.

If we are behind a proxy, we will click on the button that says "**I'm behind a proxy!**", and we will see the following screen:

On this screen you are offered the possibility to select a USB drive (or a USB stick), or a partition, that RebornOS can use as a storage space for the files you cnchi. This will allow you, in the event that the installer loses the internet connection, to avoid having to download everything again.

You can continue without selecting anything here.
