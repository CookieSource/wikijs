# How to use i3

There is an excellent i3 usage guide at the following address:

<a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html" target="_blank">How to use i3 web user guide</a>

In RebornOS, as of installer version 2021.06.09, the default **Mod1** key is **Alt**.

This same guide is in PDF format. Download here:
