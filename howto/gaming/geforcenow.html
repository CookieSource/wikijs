<h1>Geforce NOW</h1>
<p>Geforce NOW is a streaming 3D game service. &nbsp; There is a free account which allows game play of about 30 minutes and you must wait your turn in a queue to be able to start the game.<br>There is also a paid account where there are none of the restrictions that the free account has.</p>
<h2>How to play Apex Legends on your Linux system.</h2>
<p>Why Apex Legends? &nbsp;This is a Windows only AAA title that is free to play and uses the Windows EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat). &nbsp;Given that if this title will work, then other Windows only EAC games should be able to work too (Lost Ark, PUBG, Fortnite, Genshin Impact). This is a general guide which should allow you to play Apex Legends or any other Windows only game using the Geforce NOW application from AUR (geforcenow-electron).</p>
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<p>A Linux system with a fairly fast, low-latency, Internet connection and a registered GFN account login. &nbsp;Really? &nbsp;No hi-performace video card? &nbsp;GFN is a streaming gaming service, it relies on the client to be able to receive the game data which is sent over the Internet. &nbsp;Read more about the requirements to use GFN <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/system-reqs/">here.</a> &nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"GeForce NOW requires at least 15Mbps for 720p at 60 FPS, and 25Mbps for 1080p at 60 FPS. We also require less than 80ms latency from an NVIDIA data center. However, for the best experience, we recommend less than 40ms."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use an Internet speed testing website to check your bandwidth.</p>

<p><a href="https://speedcheck.org">speedcheck.org</a></p>
<p>Also, if you're in a different country, you might need to use a Proxy or VPN in order to register for GFN if your country is not supported.</p>
<h3>How to play:</h3>
<p>Installing geforcenow-electron (from AUR). &nbsp;</p>
<p><code>yay -S geforcenow-electron</code></p>
<p>Then create a GFN login, unfortunately you cannot (yet) use a Google or other linked account. &nbsp;Use your web browser and navigate to <a href="https://geforcenow.com">https://geforcenow.com</a> and hit the "Join Now" be sure to create an email login account, do not choose to link with any other account such as Google or FB, etc.</p>
<h3>Steam or other gaming account to play more games:</h3>
<p>What I do: I have a Steam account and I just go into Steam and add the games to my Library in order to play them on GFN. &nbsp;You don't need to download or install the games, just add them to your Steam game library and then when you're inside GFN, then just hit the Play button it will then stream to your Linux system (or other system). &nbsp;</p>
<p>One last thing, you also might need other accounts to play the games, such as EA which requires an account to play Apex Legends.</p>
<p>Happy gaming!</p>
