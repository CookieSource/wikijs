# How to contribute to the wiki
Want to contribute to the Wiki? Here you can find the guidelines.

The wiki provides several ways to edit.  
Including a visual editor, markdown and source code.  
You can find instructions on how to use the visual editor on [WikiJS' own wiki](https://docs.requarks.io/#user-guide).

# Formatting

1.  All titles should start with a capital letter
2.  All URLs must be lower-case
3.  Don't use underscore `_` in URLs, use a dash `-` instead.

# Categories

The wiki is divided into different categories if you write a new page you need to place it in the correct category.

Below is a breakdown of each category and what should be placed in it.

## Installation
All guides relating to installation should go in this category.

## Apps
Here you can place tutorials and guides about different apps.

## How to
How to use different Linux tools. Application tutorials should be placed in apps.

## Customization
Here you should post tutorials on customizing various aspects of the Linux system such as:
-   Theming of desktops
-   Configuration of window managers
-   Changing of boot loaders
-   Changing the default shell

## Desktops & Window managers
This category contains one page for every Desktop & Window manager.Â 

## ARM
The ARM category is for writing any content that relates to ARM specifically.

## Archive
If a page is up for deletion because it's no longer relevant it should be moved to archive.

The archive category holds all pages that no longer have any relevance. They're archived in case they become relevant again.
